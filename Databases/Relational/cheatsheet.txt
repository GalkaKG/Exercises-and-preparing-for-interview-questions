ACID Properties in Databases

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the four properties ensuring reliable processing of database transactions.
Atomicity: A transaction is atomic, meaning it is either fully completed or fully rolled back. If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
Consistency: A transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, ensuring data integrity constraints are met.
Isolation: Transactions are isolated from each other, meaning concurrent transactions do not interfere with one another (even if they are operating on the same data).
Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the case of system crashes.


What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.
