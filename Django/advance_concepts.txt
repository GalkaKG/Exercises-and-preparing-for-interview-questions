Optimize sql queries with Django:

1. select_related()
Use this for ForeignKey and OneToOne fields to reduce the number 
of queries by performing a SQL join.
Example:
# Efficiently fetch related author with each book
books = Book.objects.select_related('author')

2. prefetch_related()
Use this for ManyToMany and reverse ForeignKey relationships. 
It performs separate queries and combines them in Python.
Example:
# Prefetch genres for each book in a single additional query
books = Book.objects.prefetch_related('genres')

3. only() and defer()
Use these to load only the fields you need, avoiding large or unnecessary fields until accessed.
Example:
# Load only title and author; defer other fields
books = Book.objects.only('title', 'author')

4. QuerySet.explain()
Use .explain() to analyze how a queryset will be executed in the database. It shows the SQL execution plan, which helps you identify slow or inefficient queries.
Example:
# See how the query is executed by the database
Book.objects.filter(author=some_author).explain()

How to secure a Python backend:

"To secure a Python backend, focus on multiple layers of protection:"

1. Authentication & Authorization
Use secure, token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2, or Django’s session auth).

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or permissions.

Always hash passwords using strong algorithms (e.g., Django uses PBKDF2 by default).

2. Input Validation & Sanitization
Never trust user input. Use serializers (e.g., in Django REST Framework) to validate data.

Prevent SQL injection by always using ORM queries (never raw SQL with user input).

Sanitize user-generated HTML to prevent XSS (e.g., with bleach or Django’s autoescaping).

3. HTTPS Everywhere
Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

Use secure cookies: HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite.

4. CSRF Protection
Use Django’s built-in CSRF middleware or Flask extensions like Flask-WTF.

5. Rate Limiting & Throttling
Prevent brute-force attacks with rate limiting (e.g., django-ratelimit or flask-limiter).

6. Secure Dependencies
Keep all packages updated.

Use tools like pip-audit or safety to check for known vulnerabilities.

7. Environment & Secrets Management
Never commit secrets to version control.

Use environment variables or secret managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

8. Logging & Monitoring
Log failed login attempts, suspicious activity, and errors.

Set up alerts and log monitoring tools.
