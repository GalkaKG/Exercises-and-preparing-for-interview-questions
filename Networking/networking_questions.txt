HTTP vs. HTTPS

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring data over the web. It's not secure, and data is sent in plain text.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data during transmission, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
