1.Authentication:

Definition: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system to ensure that they are who they claim to be.
Purpose: It answers the question, "Who are you?" and establishes the identity of a user or entity.
Methods: Authentication methods include passwords, biometrics (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition), security tokens,
smart cards, and multi-factor authentication (MFA), where multiple methods are used for added security.
Examples: When you log in to your email account with a username and password, you are going through the authentication process.
The system checks if the provided credentials match the stored ones to grant access.

2.Authorization:

Definition: Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user or system is allowed to access or perform after they have been authenticated.
Purpose: It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?" and enforces access control based on the user's privileges or permissions.
Methods: Authorization is typically implemented through role-based access control (RBAC), access control lists (ACLs),
or policies that define what actions or data a user can access.
Examples: Suppose you've logged in to a web application. After authentication, the application checks your user role or permissions to decide whether you can view,
edit, or delete certain data or perform specific actions. This is the authorization process.
In summary, authentication verifies identity, ensuring users are who they claim to be, while authorization determines what actions
or resources those authenticated users are allowed to access.

Both are crucial aspects of security, and combining them helps ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions or access certain data within a system.
