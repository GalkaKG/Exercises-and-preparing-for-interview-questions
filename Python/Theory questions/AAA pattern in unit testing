Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for organizing unit tests.
It breaks tests down into three clear and distinct steps: 
  - Arrange: Perform the setup and initialization required for the test. 
  - Act: Take action(s) required for the test.
  - Assert: Verify the outcome(s) of the test.
  
  
Act -  какво тестваш
Arrange - при какви условия
Assert - какво очакваш
