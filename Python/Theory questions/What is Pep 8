PEP 8, sometimes spelled PEP8 or PEP-8, is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code.
It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan.
The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.

If you’re new to Python, it can be difficult to remember what a piece of code does a few days, or weeks, after you wrote it.
If you follow PEP 8, you can be sure that you’ve named your variables well.
You’ll know that you’ve added enough whitespace so it’s easier to follow logical steps in your code. 
You’ll also have commented your code well. All this will mean your code is more readable and easier to come back to.
As a beginner, following the rules of PEP 8 can make learning Python a much more pleasant task.
