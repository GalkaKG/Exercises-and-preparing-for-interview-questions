What is RESTful API and what are its characteristics?

A RESTful API is an architectural style for building web
services that allows for the creation, modification, 
and deletion of resources using a set of predefined operations.
Its characteristics include the use of HTTP methods
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources,
the use of URLs to identify resources,
and the use of JSON or XML to represent data.
