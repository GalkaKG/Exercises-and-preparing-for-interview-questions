Can you explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?

Answer: In Python, a list is a mutable collection of items, whereas 
a tuple is an immutable collection of items. This means that you can 
modify the contents of a list, but you cannot modify the contents of a
tuple once it has been created.
