What is Django and what are its advantages?

# Answear 1:
Django is a web framework for Python that allows you
to build web applications quickly and efficiently. 
Its advantages include its built-in ORM,
which makes working with databases easier,
its automatic admin interface, 
and its easy-to-use URL routing system.


# Answear 2:
Django is a high-level Python web framework that is
designed for rapid development and pragmatic, clean design.
It provides many built-in features such as a powerful ORM,
template engine, and an admin panel. To use Django,
you first need to install it using pip. Then, 
you create a new Django project using the django-admin startproject command. 
This creates a basic project structure with a settings file 
and a URL configuration file. You can then create apps within 
your project using the python manage.py startapp command, 
and define models, views, and templates within those apps to build your web application.
