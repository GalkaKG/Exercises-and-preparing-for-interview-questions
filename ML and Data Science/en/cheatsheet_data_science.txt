1. Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a process used to evaluate assumptions about a population based on a sample of data. 
The main idea is to formulate a hypothesis, collect data, and decide whether the data supports or contradicts the hypothesis.

Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): This is the default hypothesis assumed to be true. For example, "there is no difference between the groups."
Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): This is the opposite of the null hypothesis, which we assume if the null hypothesis is rejected.
P-value: It shows the probability of obtaining results as extreme or more extreme than the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true. 
Typically, if the p-value is less than a chosen threshold (e.g., 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected.

2. Correlation
Correlation measures the degree to which two variables move together. It indicates whether one variable increases as the other increases or decreases.

Positive Correlation: When one variable increases, the other increases as well.
Negative Correlation: When one variable increases, the other decreases.
Correlation Coefficient (r): It measures the strength of the relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. 
A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship, while a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative relationship.

3. Regression
Regression is a method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to predict the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

Linear Regression: This is the simplest form, where a line is calculated that best fits the relationship between the variables. 
The formula for linear regression is typically in the form:

ùë¶ = ùëè0 + ùëè1 ‚ãÖ ùë•  

where b0 is the intercept of the line, and ùëè1 is the slope.

Multiple Regression: This is used when there are multiple independent variables to predict the dependent variable.

4. Distributions
Distributions describe how the values of variables are spread in a dataset. They form the foundation for statistical testing and modeling.

- Normal Distribution: This is the most common distribution, characterized by a bell-shaped curve. 
Many statistical tests are based on the assumption that data follow a normal distribution.
  
- Probability Distribution: It shows the likelihood of each value of a variable occurring.
Examples include the Bernoulli distribution and Poisson distribution.
